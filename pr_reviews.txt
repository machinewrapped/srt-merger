## Code Review

This pull request is an excellent and significant refactoring, successfully converting the application to a fully client-side, serverless architecture. The removal of the Node.js backend and the transition to pure client-side JavaScript greatly simplifies deployment and improves user privacy. The code is now much better organized with the logic split into `app.js` and a new robust `srt-parser.js`. The addition of session persistence via IndexedDB and an improved file-saving mechanism are fantastic user experience enhancements.

My review focuses on ensuring the new client-side code is robust and follows modern best practices. I've identified a critical issue in `index.html` with stray tags, a few high-severity issues in `app.js` related to implicit global variables and the use of a deprecated API, and some medium-severity suggestions for code cleanup and modernization. After addressing these points, the application will be in a great state.
